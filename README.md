Group 10 Repository

## Group Work Distribution
We all met up to work on the project twice outside of class. 
Kassidy went to office hours and got help from Dr. Ledford to clean up the genre data.
We all discussed what variables to explore and graph, then Maya organized our presentation structure.
We made the graphs during our group meetings on Lejla's computer, but we all helped work on the code.
Lejla was the main person in charge of organizing our repository. Lejla also put the shiny app together.
Kassidy helped edit the shiny app code and made sure it could run smoothly. 
We got help from AI to troubleshoot errors and form the shiny app.
Maya made the Google Slides.
